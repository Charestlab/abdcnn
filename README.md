the code is programmed in Python 3.6. To install the packages required to run the code, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Most of the code is shown as jupyter notebook tutorials, and will run quickly on most modern systems. The cross-validated fitting procedure however, was implement on a high performance computing cluster and takes several days of computation for all DCNN layers.
